# Project Context

## Overview
This is an AI employee hackathon project focused on building an intelligent employee system. The project appears to be in the early stages of development with various components for orchestration, AI processing, and system monitoring.

## Key Files
- `main.py` - Main entry point for the application
- `orchestrator.py` - System orchestration logic
- `ralph_loop.py` - Possibly related to AI processing loop
- `ceo_briefing.py` - Likely contains high-level instructions or objectives
- `demonstrate_system.py` - System demonstration functionality
- `system_overview.py` - System architecture overview
- `create_test_files.py` - Test file generation utilities

## Project Structure
- `AI_Employee_Vault/` - Secure storage for AI employee data
- `mcp_servers/` - MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementations
- `watchers/` - Monitoring and event handling components

## Environment
- Python-based project with dependencies managed via requirements.txt
- MCP protocol integration for AI model communication
- Logging configured (ai_employee.log)

## Development Notes
- The project is actively being developed as part of a hackathon
- Multiple system components suggest a complex, modular architecture
- Integration with external AI services/models likely via MCP
