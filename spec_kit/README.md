# AI Employee Bronze Tier Specification Kit - Summary

## Overview
This specification kit contains all necessary documentation for the Bronze Tier implementation of the AI Employee system. The Bronze Tier represents the Foundation or Minimum Viable Deliverable with the following components:

1. Vault with Dashboard.md and Company_Handbook.md
2. One working Watcher script (Gmail or file system monitoring)
3. Qwen Code successfully reading from and writing to the vault
4. Basic folder structure: /Inbox, /Needs_Action, /Done
5. All AI functionality implemented as Agent Skills

## Kit Contents

### Core Specifications
- `SPEC_KIT.md` - Main specification document outlining Bronze Tier requirements
- `architecture_spec.md` - System architecture and component design
- `implementation_guide.md` - Step-by-step implementation and configuration guide
- `testing_validation_spec.md` - Testing procedures and validation criteria
- `deployment_ops_guide.md` - Deployment and operational procedures

### Purpose of Each Document

#### SPEC_KIT.md
Provides the comprehensive overview of the Bronze Tier requirements and implementation details, serving as the primary reference for understanding the system's scope and functionality.

#### architecture_spec.md
Details the system architecture, component relationships, data flows, and interfaces. Essential for understanding how the system is structured and how components interact.

#### implementation_guide.md
Step-by-step instructions for installing, configuring, and running the Bronze Tier implementation. Includes prerequisites, customization options, and troubleshooting guidance.

#### testing_validation_spec.md
